# Interpretable Models and Patterns for EEG data set 



## Abstract:
In this paper, we are using EEG data to establish a relationship between channel and frequency band in terms of visual activity through the human brain. The idea behind this method is that we are using SHAP as a tool to know how those different components are connected. We find accuracy in between 87â€“98% for each user for three different observations: (i) All channel, (ii) left channel, (iii) Right channel; and for that basic relationship is established.
